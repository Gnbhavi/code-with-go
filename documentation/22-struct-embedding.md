This Go program demonstrates the concept of composition in Go structs, where a struct includes another struct as a field. It also showcases method overriding through embedding and interface implementation. Let's go through each part of the code with inline comments and additional explanations:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define a struct named 'base' with a field 'num'
type base struct {
    num int
}

// Method 'describe' for the 'base' struct, returns a string describing the base struct
func (b base) describe() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("base with num=%v", b.num)
}

// Define a struct named 'container' that embeds the 'base' struct and has an additional field 'str'
type container struct {
    base // Embedding the 'base' struct
    str  string
}

func main() {
    // Create an instance of the 'container' struct with field values
    co := container{
        base: base{
            num: 1,
        },
        str: "some name",
    }

    // Print the values of the 'container' struct fields
    fmt.Printf("co={num: %v, str: %v}\n", co.num, co.str)

    // Access the 'num' field of the embedded 'base' struct directly
    fmt.Println("also num:", co.base.num)

    // Call the 'describe' method on the 'container' struct, which internally calls the 'describe' method of the embedded 'base' struct
    fmt.Println("describe:", co.describe())

    // Define an interface named 'describer' with a 'describe' method
    type describer interface {
        describe() string
    }

    // Create a variable 'd' of type 'describer' and assign the 'container' struct to it
    var d describer = co

    // Call the 'describe' method on the 'describer' interface, which calls the overridden method in the 'container' struct
    fmt.Println("describer:", d.describe())
}
```

### Output
```
co={num: 1, str: some name}
also num: 1
describe: base with num=1
describer: base with num=1
```

Explanation:

1. The `base` struct has a single field, `num`, and a method called `describe` that returns a string describing the base struct.

2. The `container` struct embeds the `base` struct, effectively inheriting its fields and methods. It also has an additional field, `str`.

3. In the `main` function:
   - An instance `co` of the `container` struct is created with field values.
   - Field values of the `container` struct are printed, and the embedded `base` struct field (`num`) is accessed directly.
   - The `describe` method is called on the `container` struct, which internally calls the `describe` method of the embedded `base` struct.
   - An interface named `describer` is defined with a `describe` method.
   - A variable `d` of type `describer` is created and assigned the `container` struct.
   - The `describe` method is called on the `describer` interface, demonstrating method overriding. The overridden method in the `container` struct is called.
