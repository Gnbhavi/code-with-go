This Go code demonstrates the use of the `time` package to create and manipulate timers. Let's go through it with inline comments:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    // Creating a timer 'timer1' that will fire after 2 seconds
    timer1 := time.NewTimer(2 * time.Second)

    // Blocking until the timer1's channel 'C' sends a value (indicating the timer has fired)
    <-timer1.C
    fmt.Println("Timer 1 fired")

    // Creating a timer 'timer2' that will fire after 1 second
    timer2 := time.NewTimer(time.Second)

    // Launching a goroutine to handle the firing of timer2
    go func() {
        // Blocking until the timer2's channel 'C' sends a value
        <-timer2.C
        fmt.Println("Timer 2 fired")
    }()

    // Stopping timer2 before it fires
    stop2 := timer2.Stop()

    // Checking if timer2 was successfully stopped
    if stop2 {
        fmt.Println("Timer 2 stopped")
    }

    // Giving some time for the goroutine to handle the stopping of timer2
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}
```
### Output
```
Timer 1 fired
Timer 2 stopped
```
Explanation:

1. `package main`: Indicates that this Go file belongs to the main executable package.

2. `import (...)`: Imports necessary packages, including "fmt" for formatting and printing, and "time" for handling time-related operations.

3. `func main() { ... }`: The main function, where the execution of the program begins.

4. `timer1 := time.NewTimer(2 * time.Second)`: Creates a timer named 'timer1' that will fire after 2 seconds.

5. `<-timer1.C`: Blocks until the channel 'C' of 'timer1' sends a value, indicating that the timer has fired. It then prints "Timer 1 fired."

6. `timer2 := time.NewTimer(time.Second)`: Creates a timer named 'timer2' that will fire after 1 second.

7. `go func() { ... }()`: Launches a goroutine to handle the firing of 'timer2'. Inside the goroutine, it blocks until the channel 'C' of 'timer2' sends a value, then it prints "Timer 2 fired."

8. `stop2 := timer2.Stop()`: Attempts to stop 'timer2' before it fires. The `Stop` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the timer was successfully stopped.

9. `if stop2 { fmt.Println("Timer 2 stopped") }`: Checks if 'timer2' was successfully stopped and prints a message if it was.

10. `time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)`: Gives some time for the goroutine to handle the stopping of 'timer2' before the program exits.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to use the `time` package to create timers, block until a timer fires, and stop a timer before it fires. The use of goroutines allows concurrent handling of timer events.
