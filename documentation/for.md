Let's go through the code step by step, explaining each part:

```go
package main

import "fmt"
```

This code defines a Go program with the main package and imports the "fmt" package, which provides functions for formatting input and output.

```go
func main() {
```

Here, the `main` function is the entry point of the program. It's where the program starts executing.

```go
    i := 1
    for i <= 3 {
        fmt.Println(i)
        i = i + 1
    }
```

This is a simple `for` loop. It initializes a variable `i` with the value 1. The loop condition is `i <= 3`, and as long as this condition is true, the loop will continue. In each iteration, it prints the value of `i` and increments it by 1.

```go
    for j := 7; j <= 9; j++ {
        fmt.Println(j)
    }
```

This is another `for` loop, but with a different style. It initializes a variable `j` with the value 7, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to 9. In each iteration, it prints the value of `j` and increments it by 1.

```go
    for {
        fmt.Println("loop")
        break
    }
```

This is an infinite loop. The absence of a condition means it will loop indefinitely. However, there's a `break` statement inside the loop, which will exit the loop after printing "loop" once. This is essentially a way to create a loop that runs until a certain condition is met, and then breaks out of it.

```go
    for n := 0; n <= 5; n++ {
        if n%2 == 0 {
            continue
        }
        fmt.Println(n)
    }
```

This is another `for` loop, iterating from `0` to `5`. Inside the loop, there's an `if` statement checking if `n` is even (`n%2 == 0`). If it's true, the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the rest of the loop's body for even values of `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints the value of `n`. This demonstrates the use of `continue` to skip specific iterations based on a condition.

The code illustrates the basic structure and usage of `for` loops, including variations such as an infinite loop and the use of `continue` to skip certain iterations.
