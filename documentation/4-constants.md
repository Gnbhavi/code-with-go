# Constants
Let's go through the code step by step to understand what each part does.

```go
package main
```
This line declares the package name, which must always be `main` for a standalone executable. The `main` package is the entry point for the Go program.

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)
```
Here, we import two packages: `fmt` for formatting and printing, and `math` for mathematical operations. These are standard libraries in Go.

```go
const s string = "constant"
```
This line declares a constant named `s` with the value "constant" and of type string. In Go, constants are immutable and their values cannot be changed after declaration.

```go
func main() {
```
This is the main function, the entry point of the program.

```go
	fmt.Println(s)
```
Prints the value of the constant `s` to the console.

```go
	const n = 500000000
```
Declares a constant `n` with the value 500000000. The type of `n` is inferred by the compiler.

```go
	const d = 3e20 / n
```
Declares a constant `d` with the value of the result of the mathematical expression `3e20 / n`. `3e20` represents 3 multiplied by 10 to the power of 20. This line demonstrates how constants can be calculated at compile time.

```go
	fmt.Println(d)
```
Prints the value of the constant `d` to the console.

```go
	fmt.Println(int64(d))
```
Converts the constant `d` to an int64 (integer with 64 bits) and prints it to the console. This conversion is necessary because the result of the division is a floating-point number, and `fmt.Println` expects an integer.

```go
	fmt.Println(math.Sin(n))
```
Calculates the sine of the constant `n` using the `math.Sin` function from the math package and prints it to the console.

```go
}
```
Closes the main function.

To run this program, save it with a `.go` extension (e.g., `main.go`) and execute it using the `go run` command in the terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The output should be something like:

```
constant
6e+11
600000000000
-0.28470407323754404
```

This tutorial covers the basic concepts of constants, data types, mathematical operations, and package imports in Go.
