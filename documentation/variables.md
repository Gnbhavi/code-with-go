Let's break down the code step by step and explain each part.

```go
package main

import "fmt"
```

This part of the code defines a Go program. The `package main` statement indicates that this is the main package, and it will be compiled into an executable program. The `import "fmt"` statement imports the "fmt" package, which provides formatted I/O functions.

```go
func main() {
```

Here, we define the main function. Every Go program must have a `main` function, and it is the entry point of the program.

```go
    var a = "initial"
    fmt.Println(a)
```

This declares a variable `a` with the value "initial" and then prints the value using `fmt.Println()`. The `var` keyword is used to declare variables, and Go will automatically infer the type of the variable based on the assigned value.

```go
    var b, c int = 1, 2
    fmt.Println(b, c)
```

Here, two variables `b` and `c` are declared with an explicit type of `int`, and values 1 and 2 are assigned to them. The `fmt.Println()` function is then used to print the values of `b` and `c`.

```go
    var d = true
    fmt.Println(d)
```

This declares a variable `d` with a value of `true` (a boolean) and prints its value using `fmt.Println()`.

```go
    var e int
    fmt.Println(e)
```

This declares a variable `e` with a type of `int` but without an initial value. In Go, if a variable is declared without an initial value, it is assigned the zero value for its type, which is 0 for integers in this case.

```go
    f := "apple"
    fmt.Println(f)
```

Here, the `:=` operator is used to declare and initialize a variable `f` with the value "apple". The type of `f` is automatically inferred based on the assigned value, which is a string in this case. The value of `f` is then printed using `fmt.Println()`.

```go
}
```

Finally, the closing brace indicates the end of the `main` function.

This Go program demonstrates variable declarations, assignments, and printing values using the `fmt` package. It also introduces the shorthand `:=` syntax for declaring and initializing variables in a single line.

### Output
```
initial
1 2
true
0
apple
```
