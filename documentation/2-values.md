This section demonstrates basic string concatenation, arithmetic operations, and boolean logic. Let's break it down step by step:

```go
// Package declaration - Every Go program starts with a package declaration.
package main

// Importing the "fmt" package - It provides functions for formatting and printing.
import "fmt"

// The main function - It is the entry point of the program.
func main() {
	// Print the concatenated string "go" + "lang"
	fmt.Println("go" + "lang")

	// Print the result of the arithmetic operation 1+1
	fmt.Println("1+1 =", 1+1)

	// Print the result of the arithmetic operation 7.0/3.0
	fmt.Println("7.0/3.0 =", 7.0/3.0)

	// Print the result of the boolean operation true && false (logical AND)
	fmt.Println(true && false)

	// Print the result of the boolean operation true || false (logical OR)
	fmt.Println(true || false)

	// Print the result of the boolean operation !true (logical NOT)
	fmt.Println(!true)
}
```
### Output
```
golang
1+1 = 2
7.0/3.0 = 2.3333333333333335
false
true
false
```

Now, let's go through each part:

1. **Package Declaration:**
   ```go
   package main
   ```
   - In Go, every program starts with a package declaration. The `main` package is a special package that serves as the entry point for the executable programs.

2. **Import Statement:**
   ```go
   import "fmt"
   ```
   - This line imports the "fmt" package, which provides functions for formatting and printing text.

3. **Main Function:**
   ```go
   func main() {
   ```
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the program. Execution of the program begins here.

4. **String Concatenation:**
   ```go
   fmt.Println("go" + "lang")
   ```
   - This line prints the concatenated string "go" + "lang" using the `Println` function from the "fmt" package.

5. **Arithmetic Operations:**
   ```go
   fmt.Println("1+1 =", 1+1)
   fmt.Println("7.0/3.0 =", 7.0/3.0)
   ```
   - These lines print the results of simple arithmetic operations. The first line prints the sum of 1 and 1, and the second line prints the result of dividing 7.0 by 3.0.

6. **Boolean Logic:**
   ```go
   fmt.Println(true && false)
   fmt.Println(true || false)
   fmt.Println(!true)
   ```
   - These lines demonstrate boolean logic. The first line prints the result of the logical AND operation between `true` and `false`. The second line prints the result of the logical OR operation. The third line prints the result of the logical NOT operation on `true`.

7. **Closing Brace:**
   ```go
   }
   ```
   - The closing brace marks the end of the `main` function.

This Go program thus introduces string concatenation, arithmetic operations, and boolean logic using the basic features of the language. It's a simple and concise example to get started with Go programming.
