# Variables

This Go code demonstrates variable declaration and initialization using different methods. Let's go through each part of the code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Declare and initialize a variable 'a' with the string value "initial"
    var a = "initial"
    fmt.Println(a)

    // Declare and initialize two variables 'b' and 'c' with integer values 1 and 2
    var b, c int = 1, 2
    fmt.Println(b, c)

    // Declare and initialize a variable 'd' with a boolean value true
    var d = true
    fmt.Println(d)

    // Declare a variable 'e' without initializing it, defaults to the zero value for its type (int in this case)
    var e int
    fmt.Println(e)

    // Short declaration and initialization of a variable 'f' with the string value "apple"
    f := "apple"
    fmt.Println(f)
}
```
### Output
```
initial
1 2
true
0
apple
```
### Explanation:

1. `var a = "initial"`: Declares a variable `a` of type string and initializes it with the value "initial". The type is inferred from the assigned value.

2. `var b, c int = 1, 2`: Declares two variables, `b` and `c`, both of type int. They are initialized with the values 1 and 2, respectively.

3. `var d = true`: Declares a variable `d` of type bool and initializes it with the value true.

4. `var e int`: Declares a variable `e` of type int without initializing it. In Go, variables that are declared without an explicit initialization are given a zero value for their type. In this case, `e` will have the zero value for an int, which is 0.

5. `f := "apple"`: Uses the short declaration syntax to declare and initialize a variable `f` with the string value "apple". The type is inferred from the assigned value.

The `fmt.Println` statements are used to print the values of these variables to the console when the program is executed.
