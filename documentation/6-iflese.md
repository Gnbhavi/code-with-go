# If Else
Let's break down the provided Go code step by step to understand each part.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
```

Here, we start by declaring a package named "main" and importing the "fmt" package, which provides functions for formatted I/O.

```go
	if 7%2 == 0 {
		fmt.Println("7 is even")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("7 is odd")
	}
```

In this block, an `if` statement is used to check if the remainder of dividing 7 by 2 is equal to 0. If true, it prints "7 is even"; otherwise, it prints "7 is odd".

```go
	if 8%4 == 0 {
		fmt.Println("8 is divisible by 4")
	}
```

This `if` statement checks if the remainder of dividing 8 by 4 is equal to 0. If true, it prints "8 is divisible by 4".

```go
	if 8%2 == 0 || 7%2 == 0 {
		fmt.Println("either 8 or 7 are even")
	}
```

This `if` statement uses the logical OR (`||`) operator to check if either the remainder of dividing 8 by 2 is equal to 0 or the remainder of dividing 7 by 2 is equal to 0. If true, it prints "either 8 or 7 are even".

```go
	if num := 9; num < 0 {
		fmt.Println(num, "is negative")
	} else if num < 10 {
		fmt.Println(num, "has 1 digit")
	} else {
		fmt.Println(num, "has multiple digits")
	}
```

This part introduces a variable `num` with the value 9, using a short declaration statement within the `if` statement. It then checks if `num` is less than 0, printing "9 is negative" if true. If `num` is not negative but less than 10, it prints "9 has 1 digit". If neither condition is met, it prints "9 has multiple digits".

This code demonstrates the use of conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`), the modulo operator (%), logical OR operator (`||`), and the short declaration statement in Go. It's a good example to understand basic control flow in Go programming.

### Output
```
7 is odd
8 is divisible by 4
either 8 or 7 are even
9 has 1 digit
```
