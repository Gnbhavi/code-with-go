This Go code demonstrates the use of a custom package called "slices" to perform sorting on slices of different types. Let's go through the code with inline comments and discussions:

```go
// The main package, which serves as the entry point for the program.
package main

// Importing necessary packages.
import (
	"fmt"
	"slices" // Custom slices package for sorting
)

// The main function, where the execution of the program begins.
func main() {
	// Example with a slice of strings
	strs := []string{"c", "a", "b"}

	// Using the Sort function from the slices package to sort the string slice.
	slices.Sort(strs)

	// Printing the sorted string slice.
	fmt.Println("Strings:", strs)

	// Example with a slice of integers
	ints := []int{7, 2, 4}

	// Using the Sort function from the slices package to sort the integer slice.
	slices.Sort(ints)

	// Printing the sorted integer slice.
	fmt.Println("Ints:   ", ints)

	// Checking if the integer slice is sorted.
	s := slices.IsSorted(ints)

	// Printing whether the integer slice is sorted or not.
	fmt.Println("Sorted: ", s)
}
```

### Output
```
Strings: [a b c]
Ints:    [2 4 7]
Sorted:  true
```

Now, let's discuss the `slices` package and its functions:

1. **slices.Sort(slice interface{})**
   - This function takes a slice of any type (interface{}) and sorts it.
   - The sorting is performed in-place, modifying the original slice.

2. **slices.IsSorted(slice interface{}) bool**
   - This function checks whether the given slice is sorted or not.
   - It returns a boolean value, true if the slice is sorted, and false otherwise.

The main function demonstrates the use of these functions with both string and integer slices. The sorted slices are then printed, and for the integer slice, it checks and prints whether the slice is sorted or not.

Make sure that the `slices` package is implemented correctly and is available in the same directory or in the Go module path for this program to work. The `import "slices"` statement assumes that there is a file named `slices.go` containing the `slices` package in the same directory as your main program.
