This Go code demonstrates working with the `time` package to handle dates and times. Let's go through the code with inline comments and explanations:

```go
// Importing necessary packages.
import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

// The main function, where the execution of the program begins.
func main() {
	// Creating an alias for fmt.Println for brevity.
	p := fmt.Println

	// Getting the current time.
	now := time.Now()
	p(now)

	// Creating a specific date and time.
	then := time.Date(
		2009, 11, 17, 20, 34, 58, 651387237, time.UTC)
	p(then)

	// Extracting various components of the time.
	p(then.Year())
	p(then.Month())
	p(then.Day())
	p(then.Hour())
	p(then.Minute())
	p(then.Second())
	p(then.Nanosecond())
	p(then.Location())

	// Determining the weekday.
	p(then.Weekday())

	// Comparing two times.
	p(then.Before(now))
	p(then.After(now))
	p(then.Equal(now))

	// Calculating the time difference.
	diff := now.Sub(then)
	p(diff)

	// Extracting components of the time difference.
	p(diff.Hours())
	p(diff.Minutes())
	p(diff.Seconds())
	p(diff.Nanoseconds())

	// Adding and subtracting time durations.
	p(then.Add(diff))
	p(then.Add(-diff))
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Getting Current Time:**
   - `time.Now()` returns the current time.

2. **Creating Specific Time:**
   - `time.Date()` is used to create a specific date and time.

3. **Extracting Components:**
   - Various methods (`Year()`, `Month()`, `Day()`, etc.) are used to extract components of the time.

4. **Weekday:**
   - `Weekday()` returns the day of the week.

5. **Comparing Times:**
   - `Before()`, `After()`, and `Equal()` methods are used to compare times.

6. **Time Difference:**
   - `Sub()` calculates the time difference between two times.

7. **Extracting Components of Time Difference:**
   - Methods like `Hours()`, `Minutes()`, `Seconds()`, and `Nanoseconds()` are used to extract components of the time difference.

8. **Adding and Subtracting Time Durations:**
   - `Add()` is used to add or subtract a time duration.

This code provides a basic overview of working with dates and times in Go using the `time` package. It covers creating, manipulating, comparing times, and calculating time differences.
