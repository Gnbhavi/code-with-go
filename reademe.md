### Collaborations and Contributions ü§ù
This is an open-source effort meant to be freely accessible by the community.

For contributing with code, here's a quick guideline üòâ
* Go to https://github.com/ineelhere/letsGo
* You need to either [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository or [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) it
* [Create a branch of your own](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository), preferably from the `dev` branch
* [Commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) your changes
* [Raise a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request-from-github-desktop) to the `dev` branch 
* Now you [chill](https://youtu.be/KOnFBHqztbM) while I review the codeü•§
